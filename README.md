# FluidAutomataJS
Port of Fluid Automata to WebGL. Works well on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

Instructions:

- Clone or download and unzip <a href="https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/FluidAutomataJS/archive/master.zip">code</a> and run fluidautomata.html from your local webserver. 

- Using the control panel, you can click on presets, change fluid and image processing paramaters, turn the fluids on and off, and change the background texture to an image, webcam, video, or colored pixels. 

Demo: 

- A working demo can be found at: http://creativecoding.evl.uic.edu/fluidautomata/.

Issues: 

- I would be grateful if someone wants to help me debug how to make sure the webcam works properly in Chrome and Safari (sometimes doesn't ask permissions to use webcam).
